    "# Explanation of the EmotionCNN Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The `EmotionCNN` class is responsible for building, training, and managing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion recognition. It comprises three main components:\n",
    "- A feature extractor to process images and extract relevant features.\n",
    "- An emotion classifier to predict emotions based on extracted features.\n",
    "- A combined model that integrates both the feature extractor and emotion classifier for end-to-end training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`__init__` Method**\n",
    "Initializes the `EmotionCNN` class and sets up placeholders for the feature extractor, emotion classifier, and combined model.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: `emotions` (list of emotion labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`build_feature_extractor` Method**\n",
    "Builds the feature extractor part of the CNN, which extracts meaningful features from input images.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create a convolutional network with three convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling.\n",
    "- **Input**: Image tensor of shape `(128, 128, 3)`.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) extract spatial features.\n",
    "  - `BatchNormalization` stabilizes training and improves convergence.\n",
    "  - `MaxPooling2D` reduces spatial dimensions to focus on high-level features.\n",
    "  - `Flatten` prepares the output for fully connected layers.\n",
    "- **Output**: A Keras `Model` object representing the feature extractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`build_emotion_classifier` Method**\n",
    "Builds the emotion classifier, which maps extracted features to emotion labels.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create a fully connected network for classification.\n",
    "- **Input**: Flattened feature tensor.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - Dense layers (`Dense`) process extracted features with `ReLU` activations.\n",
    "  - `BatchNormalization` improves stability.\n",
    "  - Final dense layer outputs probabilities for each emotion using `softmax` activation.\n",
    "- **Output**: A Keras `Model` object representing the emotion classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **`build_combined_model` Method**\n",
    "Combines the feature extractor and emotion classifier into a single end-to-end model.\n",

    "Compiles and trains the combined model or loads a pre-trained model if available.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To train the model on the provided dataset or use a pre-trained model for further evaluation.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `X_train`, `y_train`: Training data and labels.\n",
    "  - `X_val`, `y_val`: Validation data and labels.\n",
    "  - `model_save_path`: Path to save the trained model.\n",
    "  - `epochs`, `batch_size`: Training hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - Checks if a pre-trained model exists at `model_save_path`.\n",
    "  - If not, builds the feature extractor, emotion classifier, and combined model.\n",
    "  - Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.\n",
    "  - Trains the model using the provided dataset.\n",
    "  - Saves the trained model to `model_save_path`.\n",

    "# Explanation of the EmotionDetectionSystem Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The `EmotionDetectionSystem` class integrates data preparation, model training, evaluation, and live camera-based emotion detection into a single system. It acts as the main interface for running the emotion recognition pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`__init__` Method**\n",
    "Initializes the `EmotionDetectionSystem` class and sets up the components.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `train_path`, `valid_path`, `test_path`: Paths to the training, validation, and testing datasets.\n",
    "  - `emotions`: List of emotion labels.\n",
    "  - `model_save_path`: File path to save or load the trained model.\n",
    "- **Components Initialized**:\n",
    "  - `DataProcessor`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.\n",
    "  - `EmotionCNN`: Builds, trains, and manages the emotion recognition CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`run` Method**\n",
    "Executes the full pipeline: data preparation, model training/loading, evaluation, and live camera detection.\n",
    "- **Steps**:\n",
    "  1. Prepares datasets using `DataProcessor.prepare_datasets`.\n",
    "  2. Trains or loads the emotion recognition model via `EmotionCNN.compile_and_train`.\n",
    "  3. Evaluates the trained model on the test dataset and prints the test accuracy.\n",
    "  4. Launches the live camera feed for real-time emotion detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`live_camera_feed` Method**\n",
    "Captures video from a webcam and performs real-time emotion recognition.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  1. **Camera Initialization**:\n",
    "     - Opens the webcam using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`).\n",
    "     - Sets the video resolution to 1280x720.\n",
    "  2. **Frame Processing**:\n",
    "     - Captures each frame from the webcam.\n",
    "     - Converts the frame to RGB format and normalizes pixel values.\n",
    "     - Resizes the frame to match the model input size (128x128).\n",
    "  3. **Emotion Prediction**:\n",
    "     - Passes the preprocessed frame through the trained model to get emotion predictions.\n",
    "     - Extracts the predicted emotion label.\n",
    "  4. **Display**:\n",
    "     - Overlays the predicted emotion label on the video feed using `cv2.putText`.\n",
    "     - Displays the video feed in a resizable OpenCV window.\n",
    "  5. **Exit Conditions**:\n",
    "     - Closes the video feed when the user presses 'q' or clicks the close button on the window.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "  - If the camera cannot be opened, an error message is printed.\n",
    "  - Handles cases where frames cannot be read from the camera."
