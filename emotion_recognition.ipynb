    "### Purpose\n",
    "- Organizes the AffectNet dataset downloaded via KaggleHub into a structured format compatible with the emotion recognition program.\n",
    "- Moves images into emotion-specific folders (`Anger`, `Happy`, etc.) for training, validation, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "1. **Defines Input and Output Paths**:\n",
    "   - Takes the original KaggleHub dataset location as `base_path`.\n",
    "   - Organizes the files into an `AffectNET` folder in the current working directory (`destination_base_path`).\n",
    "2. **Emotions Mapping**:\n",
    "   - Maps labels from `labels` files to emotion folder names (`Anger`, `Happy`, etc.).\n",
    "3. **File Organization**:\n",
    "   - Reads label files (`.txt`) to identify the emotion associated with each image.\n",
    "   - Copies images into their respective emotion folders under `train_organized`, `valid_organized`, and `test_organized`.\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Skips missing files and directories, providing warnings in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "- Creates a folder structure:\n",

    "# Explanation of the EmotionCNN Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The `EmotionCNN` class is responsible for building, training, and managing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion recognition. It comprises three main components:\n",
    "- A feature extractor to process images and extract relevant features.\n",
    "- An emotion classifier to predict emotions based on extracted features.\n",
    "- A combined model that integrates both the feature extractor and emotion classifier for end-to-end training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`__init__` Method**\n",
    "Initializes the `EmotionCNN` class and sets up placeholders for the feature extractor, emotion classifier, and combined model.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: `emotions` (list of emotion labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`build_feature_extractor` Method**\n",
    "Builds the feature extractor part of the CNN, which extracts meaningful features from input images.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create a convolutional network with three convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling.\n",
    "- **Input**: Image tensor of shape `(128, 128, 3)`.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) extract spatial features.\n",
    "  - `BatchNormalization` stabilizes training and improves convergence.\n",
    "  - `MaxPooling2D` reduces spatial dimensions to focus on high-level features.\n",
    "  - `Flatten` prepares the output for fully connected layers.\n",
    "- **Output**: A Keras `Model` object representing the feature extractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`build_emotion_classifier` Method**\n",
    "Builds the emotion classifier, which maps extracted features to emotion labels.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To create a fully connected network for classification.\n",
    "- **Input**: Flattened feature tensor.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - Dense layers (`Dense`) process extracted features with `ReLU` activations.\n",
    "  - `BatchNormalization` improves stability.\n",
    "  - Final dense layer outputs probabilities for each emotion using `softmax` activation.\n",
    "- **Output**: A Keras `Model` object representing the emotion classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The `FeatureExtraction` class provides a static method to visualize features extracted by a feature extractor model. This is helpful for understanding what parts of an input image the model focuses on during processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`visualize_features` Method**\n",
    "Visualizes the features extracted from an image by creating a heatmap overlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `image`: Input image (assumed to be preprocessed and resized to match the model's input shape).\n",
    "  - `feature_extractor`: A pre-trained feature extractor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  1. **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "     - Passes the image through the `feature_extractor` to obtain the feature map.\n",
    "     - The feature map is reshaped to its original dimensions (e.g., `16x16xN` for a 16x16 spatial resolution with `N` channels).\n",
    "  2. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "     - Aggregates the feature map across channels by taking the mean, resulting in a 2D spatial representation.\n",
    "  3. **Normalization**:\n",
    "     - Normalizes the aggregated feature map to the range `[0, 1]` for visualization.\n",
    "  4. **Resizing**:\n",
    "     - Rescales the normalized feature map to the original image size (`128x128` by default).\n",
    "  5. **Heatmap Generation**:\n",
    "     - Converts the feature map into a heatmap using OpenCVâ€™s `COLORMAP_JET`.\n",
    "     - Converts the heatmap from BGR to RGB format.\n",
    "  6. **Overlay Creation**:\n",
    "     - Blends the heatmap with the original image to create an overlay that highlights regions of high activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns**:\n",
    "  - `overlay_image`: The input image with the heatmap overlaid.\n",
    "  - `heatmap`: The generated heatmap, useful for standalone visualization."

    "     - Displays the video feed in a resizable OpenCV window.\n",
    "  5. **Exit Conditions**:\n",
    "     - Closes the video feed when the user presses 'q' or clicks the close button on the window.\n",
