# Emotion Recognition Project

This project focuses on emotion recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with prioritized convolution.

## Overview

Emotion recognition is a process of identifying human emotions from facial expressions. This project leverages a CNN model to accurately classify emotions from images.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN model for emotion recognition
- Implements prioritized convolution for improved performance
- High accuracy in emotion classification

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmet-Toplu/emotion_recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd emotion_recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
